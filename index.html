                            <p>The goal of the game is to get your score to equal the target score. Crystals are
                                assigned a value and must be clicked to add to your current score. If you reach the
                                target score or go over the game will track it as a win or a loss and reset using
                                different target score.</P>

                            <a href="https://iceberg09.github.io/amazing-rebels/" target="_blank">Fly Buy Flight Lookup</a>

                            <p>Site designed to look up cheap flight destinations when on a budget. Once a destination
                                is presented, you can click on it to show events in that area during your stay that you
                                can go to. Clicking on the event links will bring you directly to Ticketmaster's site
                                for that event.</p>

                            <p>Can be used to track different trains using Firebase. New trains can be added by the
                                user and will then show for everyone using the site. Moment.js is also used to track
                                the next arrival and the minutes away from that arrival in real time.</p>

                                This was our second group project that I worked on with 4 other people in my Univerity of Minneosta Full-Stack Web Development boot camp.
                                We created a website where people can go to rate other drivers on the road. The technologies that we used were HTML, CSS, Bootstrap,
                                Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, MySQL, along with Passport.js and BCrypt for user authentication. Our presentation to our class on how the 
                                application works can be seen <a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1CgpASur37QsaAC9Hlp9yLuCgj8OuOO6Dpg4lWD7MSO0/edit?usp=sharing">here</a>.
