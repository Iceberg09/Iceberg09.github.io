Challenges: I remember having issues with getting the buttons to show up on the page properly. I think like a lot of the problems I have had throughout this course, I was able to step away from the project, come back a couple hours later, and take a clean look at the code to figure out what was wrong (hint: I believe I had 1 letter missing from a variable that threw it off).

Challenges: Still working through this one actually. Unfortunately I haven't taken the time to go back and fix, but I will need to. I wasn't able to complete the moment.js portion of this assignment.

Challenges: For this project, the new library we decided to use was Bulma. I had no previous experience, but was the one tasked with learning how bulma works and designing the framework of the web page with it. The toughest part with using Bulma is they don't have the same search features that Bootstrap does for their documentation, so it takes quite a bit more time to find what you're looking for sometimes.

Challenges: The toughest part I found with this (and you'll notice it still doesn't look perfect) is getting the crystals to take up the correct amount of space on the bottom of the page. For some reason, when trying to use col-3 for all 4, 1 of the crystals would go underneath the rest of the. Still a work in progress.
